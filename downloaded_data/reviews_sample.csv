271781,bluejacket74,2017-03-17,"   750 ml bottle, 2016 vintage, bottle #304 of 360. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like dark fruit (raisin, plum), chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of licorice. For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but with some coffee flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, worth picking up if you want a nice straight forward imperial stout. Here's hoping Four String brings this back in the future! $9.99 a bottle.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.03

125646,GratefulBeerGuy,2017-12-20,"   0% 16 oz can. Funny story: As I finally walked in the doors after a 45 min wait in line and freezing temps the sweet sound of the Grateful Dead's Sugar Magnolia greeted me from the TreeHouse sound system. The bottom of the can reads: ""Going where the wind goes, bloomin' like a red rose"" A white haze to the yellow and golden liquid. Thick and healthy, totally unfiltered. Brawny white foam cap, thick, all-white clumps. Huge lacing left over. The aroma has a very zesty citrus hop effect, mellon and mango, grainy earthiness, tropical fruit blend with a bitter to sweet effect, then a peppery kick at the end. Very aromatic. The flavor is just bursting with complex hops, zesty earthy tones, sweet orange, peppery malt, clean fresh feel and overall vibe. A crispy bite wakes you up, full and lush mouthfeel follows from a totally unfiltered expereince. The feel and flavor finishes with a fun, earthy, zesty dry bite. Tropical juicy, zesty citrus, zippy golden wheat malt, melons, rustic earthiness sums up the taste pretty well. Levels of complexity are deep. It's an interesting ride for sure. Overall, this one stands somewhere near the top of the New England IPA's.  ",4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.58

125646,MFMB,2017-12-16,"   Pours a creamy opaque light straw yellow with a whispy frothy white head. Nose is of citrus skin and light pine. Taste is a thing of beauty! A nice citrus punch in the mouth. Both peeland zest as well as juice of oranges, grapefruit and lemon. Nice malt backbone although minimal presence, you know its there because the hoppyness of this beer is perfectly balanced. Meadium creamy body. Smooth to drink. Finishes with with a Nice pungent citrus bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip to start the process over again. By far my favorite Treehouse brew of the 4 or 5 I’ve had.  ",4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.52

This unique brown pours a deep muddy blackish brown with an excellent head of dark tan foam that subsides to a thick ring, modest pool, and features some nice sudsy lacing. Nose of coconut milk, cocoa, and light cola notes. Flavors lightly exceed the nose with deeply roasted coconut with dark cola and cocoa flavors with a touch of chicory note to it on the rear of the taste. Nice mouth feel; coating, medium carbonation, medium body, and a bitter malt finish with just of touch of herbal hops. Overall it is a nice unique little brew. Cheers  ",4.0,3.75,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.92

Sweet with plenty of coconut and cocoa, but with something different..a twist. There’s also a spiciness, like chicory in there…like a root beer spice. This one is really packed with deep flavor, rich and unusual. Not your father’s coconut brown ale, yes. Delicious, for sure!  ",3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.07

150672,byronic,2016-04-14,   Poured a bit lively and had to wait for it to settle very nice lacing. Slightly hazy golden straw. Floral notes maybe a hint of citrus. Quite smooth on the palate a touch bitter and definitely a pungent finish as advertised. Somewhat of a dry finish and something about the lingering taste is off. The mouth coating is a touch creamy.  ,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75

150672,KingHoppy,2015-08-14,"   Passing through Swift Current SK, I stopped at Original Joe's for a late night meal. Many times previously, they had no IPAs whatsoever so I almost didn't ask but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised they were now carrying the hometown craft beer IPA! by Black Bridge Brewery. Notes of citrus, pine, floral, everything you could want in an IPA and with a respectable 7% alcohol kick as well. Very well balanced with the malt. Immediately it was one of my favorite American style IPAs. The next day I went to the Swift Current liquor store and bought three 4-packs. I haven't seen it outside of Swift Current, SK but since it's a new brewery they will surely expand to other locations. If you're passing through Swift Current, you got to try this beer - otherwise keep your eyes open for it in your local beer store.  ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.28

150672,biboergosum,2014-12-26,"   355ml can, the latest from this nascent craft brewery from Swift Current, Saskabush. This beer pours a clear, medium copper amber hue, with four flabby fingers of puffy, rocky, and somewhat bubbly bone-white head, which leaves some exploded bike chain lace around the glass as things quickly subside. It smells of pungent, and sort of dank piney, leafy hops straight off, with a strong pithy orange, white grapefruit, and lemon rind citrus fruit abettor, some chalky flintiness, and a middling grainy caramel malt sweetness. The taste is gritty, grainy pale and semi-sweet caramel malt, a muddled green forest floor detritus bitterness, musty orange, lemon, and pineapple citrus notes, a still persistent earthy flintiness, and the suggestion of a hint of a wisp of metallic warming alcohol. The carbonation is fairly peppy and engaging in its low-key fizzy and outright frothy nature, the body an adequate medium weight, and more or less smooth, the hops displaying some down-home hospitality, they are. It finishes off-dry, the malt not ready to cede the flag just yet, while the hops start a campaign to consider a plan to circle the wagons. A pleasantly rendered, high-octane IPA, the hops more prevalent up top, but that's ok, the beer overall doesn't lag as a result, like some. Anyways, nice to see another well made local-ish IPA, and in cans to boot - hope to see this still around next summer, when I finally try to get back out camping, toddler in tow.  ",3.75,4.25,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.97

Smell has some decadent rich caramel and toffee aromas along with a bourbon soaked raisin sweet aroma and lightly tart dark red cherry aroma.Tons of vanilla tannins and barrel notes are balanced along side some light roasted marshmellow, and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose with a big caramel and toffee sweetness hitting the palat first along side some fig and date flavors. Loads of vanilla tannin and toasted marshmellow come out along with some oak barrel and bourbon flavors,roasted malt, a walnut like nutty flavor and moderate amounts alcohol in the finish. Super tastey. Mouthfeel is really rich and creamy, a nice sipping beer. Completely costs the mouth with sticky sweet goodness.  ",4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.57

104824,kevanb,2014-05-24,"   12oz bottle poured into a Pipeworks snifter. The beer pours a jet black color and has extreme opacity with a very thick texture. A thin but taut khaki head rises that has decent retention and leaves some spotted lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, plenty of vanilla bean, lots of toasted coconut, lots of earthy wood with light bourbon, chocolate is bittersweet and brings out both a light roast quality and some hazelnuts. It's very complex but easily approachable and inviting. The flavors are just as impressive, massive coconut presence with some strong vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, charred wood with a bit of chalkiness in small doses. The body is a bit lighter than I expected, very silky and it coats the mouth well while the finish is delicate and smooth. Verdict: An absolute stunner from Pipeworks. A textbook example of improving upon a base beer using barrels, adds not only complexity but depth. The balance of flavors is wonderful, everything in harmony, both sweet and earthy. This is easily my favorite Pipeworks beer to date and a remarkably good stout.  ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.45

74580,grogged,2012-05-15,"   On tap at the Red Lion Grog House. Served in 16 oz glass w/ Fountain Square Brewing logo. Pours a deep brown with a creamy tan head that looks delicious. The smell was fragrant, almost earthy, yet slight off. Roasted coffee comes to mind, but there's an industrial whiff to it also. The mouthfeel is different. The carbonation stands out noticeably and not for the better. Full, yet fizzy and inconsistent. The coffee taste comes to the fore and so does the bitterness. The problem I had with this beer is that the bad carbonation notes and the bitterness linger too long in the brut(al) finish. I can love a beer that's slightly off, but this one was too far off for me. A drain pour.  ",3.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.43

The nose features slight coffee, slight dark chocolate, and bitter roast. It solid, more bitterness than most. The flavors feature coffee and cream first and foremost. The chocolate is light subtly sweet. It finishes off dry and bitter. It drinks smoothly and between light and medium in body. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice first experience from this brewer. I'll try more of their beers in the future.  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.58
58482,Imstillthegman,2009-08-17,"   This one pours a cloudy rusty orange with about a fingers worth of off-white head. The head quickly faded to a ring, but left nice lacing. The aroma is a basic version of what I had hoped for. Sweet fruit and candi sugar with a bit of peppery yeast and a herbal/floral hop note. Not bad, just doesn't wow me. The flavor is quite enjoyable. I get the yeast right up front quickly followed by the sugars and fruit (pear and apple). The yeast comes back into play again with a nice pepper bite before I get the earthy hops. Active carbonation keeps the flavor going after the swallow. Not too bitter, more dry and white peppery. Very enjoyable brew that I will pick up again.  ",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.98
205644,Jaypeajus,2016-06-08,"   Not sure what to expect except I look forward to coconut..looks ok, not much head retention, much darker than brown, but I'm new to brown ales. First smell is like a smokey bock, whiffs of chocolate, tastes of charred chocolate cinnamon burnt banana slight mintyness, smokehouse flavors but not much of any coconut to me, bummed a bit about that. Feel is viscous not much in the hop register leaves a smokey residue on the tongue and mouth. Overall pretty complex very drinkable but no coconut and I only bring it up cos the label says it. Oh it does say toasted coconut so maybe that's all the smokiness. First burn em brew and it was good.  ",4.0,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.66

Nice aroma, possibly the best part of the beer, good irish malt feel, bourbon and oak plenty strong but not overly done. Smooth taste, relatively easy drinking, good bourbon delivery vessel. Mild roasted malt notes, dark fruit way in the back, not overripe, not bitter, pretty smooth, carbonation spot on. Good stuff, nice use of barrel in this one.  ",3.25,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.02

174137,JerzDevl2000,2017-06-08,"   11 1/2 years on here and never did I review a beer in a crowler, until today. Someone I trade with got me this a while back and I finally got around to cracking this 32 oz'er down on this cool morning. I'll give any brewery in my home state a go and for a first impression, this wasn't that bad. Not much information was given on the can except that Village Idiot was located in Mount Holly and that the ABV was 6.8%, and not the 6.5% listed on here... Nice pour to this, as the beer had a deep and hazy golden hue to it, with plenty of head on top to boot. Deep rings of soapy lacing were left behind as the head had a nice retention as I worked my way through this. Not a strong aroma to this but there was a good amount of honey sweetness present to draw me in. Metallic hops, citrus pith, and a grassy undertone all combined for an unusual, but relatively pleasing taste that was pretty full while making this beer seem more like a balanced Pale Ale than an IPA. A low amount of carbonation, spicy malt presence like bread, and medium body kept this from feeling too heavy though this could have been a bit more balanced! Just the right amount of alcohol in here given the massive size of this. Nice job on this beer as I'm intrigued as to what else these guys are capable of. Time to start canning and getting more New Jersey breweries onto the proverbial map!  ",4.25,3.5,4.0,4.25,4.0,3.92

S: Sweet fruits with some candy sweetness and a nice floral hop smell. Not overly complex, but nice. T: Sweeter fruits start first with hints of pear, apple, orange followed by a deep candy sweetness and maybe some bubblegum. A nice yeasty spicy funk is tasted and then you get this massive hop hit. Tastes of floral spicy earthy hops linger at the finish and leave a nice bitterness. Not overly complex again, but very nice. M: Medium and coating with some prickly aspects. Nice lingering bitterness. D: High, these are really drinkable, and the abv is totally hidden. Overall this beer is a tweener to me, but a perfect tweener. It's hoppier than a BPA, but not as hoppy as a Belgian IPA. It really is a great beer that is really enjoyable. Dan, this beer is wonderful, I love it. If you brew it regularly, I will buy it.

Clear orange in color, with a decent amount of white head. Lots of bubbles are racing to the top of this beer. Musty smells start things off and stay throughout, with traces of fruit thrown in here and there. More phenols in the taste, along with some grapefruit-esq hops, and a dry finish. Medium bodied, this is one crisp and refreshing Belgian beer. Drinking it is pretty damn easy too. Here we have another winner from Weyerbacher.

58482,dogfishandi,2009-08-10,"   MY 100TH REVIEW kinda wish i couldve had a little better beer than this for the 100th, but the next 2 should make up for it. pours a hazy glowing orange amber color. big fluffy head, almost pure white faded to a ring half way through the glass. just a touch of lacing. in the aroma your hit with big bubblegum and bananna from the yeast, some spiciness, floralness, from the hops i imagine. the aroma almost reminds me of the flouride u used to get from the dentist when you were a kid. for the taste you get some of the belgian yeast character, flouride taste, and then you get a lot of american hops. the 2 flavors combined create a kind of spiciness, almost peppery if you will. finishs a dry bitter spicy flavor that lingers. seems more like a belgian APA. doesnt seem to have the soft fluffy goodness of the true belgian PAs. for this i go down in the score a little, still a very good beer. smooth mouthfeel, medium body. good carb. but just not the same as an authentic belgian. good drinkability.  ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.8
58482,DanielClouser,2009-08-09,"   I recently thought about the idea of toning down the bold new Belgian IPA style to a Belgian APA. I think Weyerbacher had the same idea, and Zotten is the result, as it is not consistent with the classic BPA style. Overall, it was very successful, but there was a pervasive grassy sort of bitterness in the flavor that really hurt the brew (especially its drinkability). I think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer, as it otherwise has potential to be excellent.  ",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.5,3.3
58482,Patrick999,2009-08-06,"   Pours an attractive shiny pale copper, like a penny. Copious bubblegum in the nose, some clove. I thought it was an impressive strong aroma. Nice flavor, a Belgian pale with much of the sweet bubblegum flavor, cut with a dose of citrusy American hops. A flavorful little beer. It doesn't feel as light and pillowy as a from-Belgium Belgian pale, but few American interpretations of the style do. Good beer. I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I do.  ",3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.04
58482,JohnQVegas,2009-08-05,"   Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass. Pours a hazy bright copper, just a bit on the dark side, with a thin, fizzy off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Nose is nice - tangy tropical fruit and spices (coriander?), c-hops come though citrusy and pungent. Yeast comes through tangy and just a bit peppery. I like this one, though the northwestern hops tend to steal the show just a bit - they could be toned back a tad. Or at least made cleaner, their pungency is what's holding this one back. Taste carries more notes of lightly pungent c-hops, citrus and tropical fruit, big and spicy yeast note, peppery even. Light to moderate bitterness towards the finish that carries with the peppery, spicy note on the finish. Interesting, but the c-hops really take an overly heavy hand with this one in my opinion - give me a Belgian pale with grassy noble hops any day of the week. Not as subtle as I'd like it to be, but still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is ok. The hops are laid on a little thick and rob the beer of the lightness I was hoping for, the body being a bit full as a result. Not as dry as I was hoping for either. Drinkability is pretty nice. When they say Belgian Pale Ale, I think they mean, Belgian-influenced American Pale Ale, not Belgian Pale Ale as in the traditional Belgian style. At least that's my take on it anyway. Still, not exactly what I would call a resounding success - not every style is made better with a big punch of American hops. Leads me to wonder what a classic like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which isn't quite as heavy handed with the hops, would do with such a treatment. Compared to the classics of the style like Orval, though, this one isn't even close.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.92
58482,wiseguy142,2009-07-30,"   Pretty good looking. Amazing viscous head, lasts a while with some quickly dried up foamy lacing. Not a big fan of the color.. sort of a stereotypical beer color but there's nothing wrong iwth it. The aroma is almost too much for my 1 unclogged nostril to handle. Sort of a pungent Belgian smell. I'm not a huge Belgian fan in general and it comes off to me as smelling like bleach. Otherwise very floral to sort of an extreme, like smelling a scented candle. The taste again follows the bleachy smell. Maybe I'm sensitive to this because some of my early homebrews had problems with phenols, but this is a phenol phuck phest. Sweet and tart around the edges with a hint of alcohol. You can tell the beer is bottle conditioned because it feels a bit foamy immediately when it enters your mouth. Drinkability not so much. I'm having trouble finishing this. I don't think it's bad per say. I read in BA mag that some people were claiming it's too young and I think I tend to agree. Never been a big fan of Belgian Pale Ales in the first place- the Belgians I really like are the Strong Dark Ales but I wanted to try this out. I'm going to save the rest of the 4-pack for a few months and try again.  ",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.05

Deep golden honey brown, expected cloudiness from lees. Three finger white head, fine bubbles, subsides slowly to good lacing. Smell is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale, yeast, spice and citrus, maybe a hint of melon and banana too. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth and almost creamy form the fine carbonation. Taste, like smell, is as expected from a Belgian style pale ale with great yeast and a slight hoppy finish. One interesting, and very pleasant, flavor note is a slight herby flavor reminiscent of fresh dill. Eminently drinkable.  ",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.42

Soft and rounded. T: More of the same. Pleasant, if not bland. Lacking in the depth to elevate to the next level. Mostly breaded malts and soft banana / yeast notes. M: Smooth. Clean finish.

Tart fruit right away, then a mild sweetness with spice follows to tone it down. This is quickly followed by an unexpected bitter hop bite. The aftertaste wavers between bitter, sweet, and astringent. M- Medium in body and well carbonated. Finish is clean but unusual with the lingering bittersweet tastes. D- Alcohol is well hidden and at 6% ABV it is pretty drinkable. I'm not sure if I would be able to session this one though. Tastes a little out of balance and not as smooth as I would expect a Belgian style to be. The finish is the flaw for me. Worth trying.  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.38

Pours an interesting pale orange hue, a bit like me when I've been out in the sun too long. A pass of the glass beneath my ass (nose) yields an interesting amalgam of the wheatiness of a hefe & the yeastiness of a Belgian. Interesting beer. The taste is a perfect mirror of the smell: Belgian candy & yeast, with a grassy, wheatishness that would be comfy in a hefe. Beneath the surface there are some summer fruits, & spices, maybe a bit of banana & cinnamon or something to contribute some depth & interest. Tart & dry on the tongue, with a mid-July taste that begs for a lawn chair & a copy of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"". Very good brew. Glad to have tried another Weyerbacher experiment, & a successful one at that. Start sending some of these north!  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.95

58482,cvstrickland,2009-07-14,"   Zotten pours brightly clear and brassy golden in color with a finger's thickness of grainy white foam atop. Steady streamers feed a slumping bubble-cap that retains at a thick sheet and deposits sliding lacing onto the sides of my shaker pint glass. The smell is sweet and fruity, with prominent peach-infused notes of spice-sprinkled sweet green banana. A light graininess laced with fresh-cut grass gains in stature as the drink progresses. The taste is mildly sweet and non-denominationally fruity with a wink of peppery spice and a stiff grassy bitterness that dries the finish. A mellow yeasty nuttiness provides earthy grounding for the profile. The drink is medium in body with crisp carbonation and is quite drinkable.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.07

It smelled like fresh wheat and wild yeast and lemon hops, with candi sugar and salty cloves and earthy caramel. It tasted like sour lemon and wild yeast, with copper and caramel and fresh wheat, along with a bit of coriander and clove. It was fairly thin with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this had a nice clean taste that started out a bit overly sour, but became richer and smoother as it warmed. It had a nice balance of spices, and decent body, so it was easy to drink.

200826,ShanePB,2015-11-30,"   Served on draft at Spring House Brewing Co. Reddish pink colored body with a quickly dissipating head. No lacing or retention. Aromas of cranberry, oak, white wine and sourness. Flavor is a bit more muted with the fruit flavor than the nose would lead you to believe. Delicate hints of cranberry along with a wash of sourness. Not much wine on the taste, either. The peach version of this is way, way better.  ",,,,,,3.55

259020,AdmiralOzone,2018-01-30,"   Pours a murky apricot color with a small off white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is the highlight of this beer, smells of tangerine, grapefruit and marmalade. The flavor is very sweet and malty with hardly any hop bitterness. No date on this can but presumably fairly fresh. The feel is fine, but overall a beer that I won't purchase (but wouldn't turn down if someone brought me some).  ",3.25,4.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.57
259020,Czequershuus,2017-11-23,"   This beer pours a medium amber with an average head. The aroma features notes of pineapple, mandarin oranges, grapefruit peel, and caramel. The flavor is quite sweet upfront with caramel notes, followed by candied pineapple, overripe mango, peach, and a a burnt sugar finish. The mouthfeel is medium with abundant foam y carbonation. Overall this is a bit of a muddled beer, with too much sweetness and slightly off hop flavors. Decent, but not something I would get again.  ",3.5,3.25,3.0,3.75,3.25,3.22

311190,woodychandler,2018-04-23,"   I just wrapped up my stated intention for New Beer Sunday (Week 687) & while I was not done for the day, I decided to close out there. The CANQuest (tm) CANtinues with this N2 CAN. From the CAN: ""The Can That You Shake!""; ""Keep Me Ice Cold""; ""Get Whipped[:] 1[)] Gently Shake the Can to Activate Nitrogen. 2[)] Open Then Invert Can Over Your Glass And Pour Hard."" I had kept it cold, but I read in several places that agitation led to gushing so I erred on the side of caution. My Crack! & inverted Glug may have been a bit less aggro than the brewers intended, but it all seemed to work out. I got a decent cascade that formed two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, deep-brown head with excellent retention, still hanging in as I type. Color was dead Black/Opaque (SRM =44), allowing ZERO light penetration. In fact, I thought that it might be sucking the light out of the room. Nose was definitely chocolate, but it was a dark/baker's/semi-sweet chocolate. This was no playing around, especially with its ABV. Mouthfeel was big, thick & full, like a dollop had been scooped onto my tongue. The taste was rich and chocolaty, but really smoky and bitter. Whew! Finish was definitely dry and bitter, but with a lingering chocolate aspect.  ",4.0,4.25,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.09

A: Black body with 2-finger medium beige head with staying power but a little lackluster on the lacing. S: Delicious dark chocolate and medium caramel aromas with a little nutty note in there. I don't get much vanilla per se, but I think the intensity of the other aromas is heightened due to this addition. T: Flavor is a disappointment with a good blast of medium bittersweet chocolate with caramel sweetness but then it just heads to bitterness which seems off to me. The roast quality is too intense as well and does not work well with the above-average bitterness for the style. Alcohol presence is not heavy and there is no yeast character. M: Not as smooth as I was expecting due to the spiky bitterness. Medium body and low carbonation character due to the nitrogen. O: Decent beer but not a good value at all. I am not sure the imperial milk stout style works well but especially when the roast and bitterness is amped up like in this beer.  ",4.25,4.0,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.69

Inverted the can while pouring and it formed a beautiful buckwheat pancake batter head. The beer is pitch black in color.Very rich aromas of milk chocolate and roasted malt but then it kind of cuts short. The tasting notes had very rich milk chocolate, almost brownie battered flavored with a rich sweet malt backbone. Just subtle hints of sweet vanilla at the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very dense. Overall I find the aroma and flavors just a little muted, thanks to the nitro. Also more expensive when compared to the Lefthand Milk Stout. Still good beer overall. It really doesn't taste like an 8% beer.  ",4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.94

T: The taste has flavors of dark and chocolate malts with a light amount of roast and hints of coffee beans. There is a light amount of bitterness. No alcohol is perceptible. The roasted flavors become stronger in the finish and linger through the aftertaste. M: It feels medium-bodied and silky smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

104824,KFBR392,2014-05-06,"   Batch #209 Appearance: On an aggressive pour, only a light ring of head formed on the edges of the glass. Pours deep dark brown and sits jet black in the glass. Light active carbonation. This beer looks like a huge, menacing barrel aged brew. Smell: The front of the nose is filled with potent bourbon and that familiar lactose sweetness found in many PW stouts. The barrel character carries throughout bringing oak, light smoke, and cherries on the body. The vanilla meshes so well with the bright alcohol sting. Lingering milk chocolate rounds out on the back end. Taste: Lactose sweetness filled with milk chocolate and vanilla hits the palate first. Barrel character warms up on the front of the body and continues to build slowly through, lingering long after drinking. Mossy oak meshes well in the body with the sweetness and chewy malt in this brew brings. Expected more barrel character after the aroma but more of the chocolate, vanilla, and lactose come through. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is an excellent middle ground, providing rich heavy malts but being light enough to allow the decadent flavors to shine through. Carbonation is very light which really gives this brew the feeling of a dessert beer. Overall: Extremely impressed with this. I love that the bourbon characteristics in this brew are so familiar to actually drinking Buffalo Trace. A definite alcohol sting with perfect accents of cherries and oak are all too familiar. I love a big barrel character which this brew brings yet the vanilla and chocolate tones come through very clearly as well. Awesome.  ",4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.46

Poured from a 22oz Bomber, pours light orange/dark yellow with minimal head. Descent carbonation. Aroma is faint, smells like a mix of Columbus and Nelson Sauvin. Aroma is probably faded due to age of beer. Taste is fine, mild sweetness with a low bitterness level for an IIPA ( I would guess 50 IBUs at this point) Pretty smooth overall, nothing spectacular, however due to its age it taste more like a blonde Barleywine, I would bet good money this IIPA taste vastly different fresh.

Moderately low retention efforts that slip away to just a thin film hugging the edge of the glass. Some light dots and streak of stick remain after each sip. S: Smells real floral with a twist of tangerine and pine. There is a base of caramel malt sweetness emerging to round out the nose. Pleasant hoppy aromas with a nice botanic quality. T: Tastes of floral hops mixed with citrus zest and pine resin. A touch sweeter with some caramel malt presence and bit of toasted pale malts. There is a light tropical flare coming in. Moderate to higher level of bitterness to the beer and a bit of alcohol coming through in flavor. M: Moderate sized body with a nice smooth texture. Carb is a touch on the lower side but does not detract from the overall quality. Nice drying crisp on the finish. Touch of residual linger. D: A fair DIPA with some nice hoppy flavors made up of mostly floral and citrus. A touch on the sweeter side but with honest balance. Slightly unremarkable but nothing really flawed.  ",3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.65
92616,DoubleJ,2013-06-13,"   On-tap at the source itself and served in an 8 ounce snifter. On to the beer: It's amber orange colored and given a tiny head on the pour, leaving a few whisps of lace. This Double IPA goes down the route of a juicy IPA rather than a grapefruit or pine bomb, giving off nice tropical flavors which aren't too intense. Its alcohol is hidden as well, a bonus. However, like the other two Aftershock beers which I samples, has little carbonation. Good as it stands, but with more bubbles has potential to get to the next level.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.25,3.75,3.85

195387,Darkmagus82,2015-10-16,"   Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a deep orange amber color with a two finger head of fizzy white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a lighter level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is rather strong of pumpkin pie aroma with a strong roasted pumpkin mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar. Along with these smells comes some aromas of a biscuit smell and a little bit of earthy smell. Taste – The taste begins with a rather crisp pumpkin flavor that has a decent sum of roast and spice of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice along with a little bit of brown sugar and caramel. As the taste moves forward the roast increases a bit with some other light hop flavors of earth and grass coming to the tongue as well. While up to this point there was almost no cream ale taste to the brew, toward the end, the cream really starts to kick it up; mixing with the roasted pumpkin nicely to create a rather pleasant, not too sweet, roasty but smooth pumpkin pie flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is rather thin with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. I would have liked a little more body and a bit less carbonation on this one, which would have complimented the roasted pumpkin flavors nicely. Overall though, it was a decent feel I suppose. Overall- This was a rather nice drinking, non-very sweet, modest abv. pumpkin ale. The touch of cream ale flavor at the end matches the pumpkin flavors nicely and creates a rather pleasant drinker.  ",,,,,,3.85

125646,digboy,2017-10-30,"   Can dated 9/14/17 - about 6 weeks old, which may influence the review (i.e. hop flavor has faded a bit) Pours a very cloudy, vibrant orange-gold color with a 2 finger fluffy head that leaves nice lacing as it dies down. Aroma has fragrant notes of orange and nectarine and some pine, not too strong but very present. As it warms up a little more alcohol comes through on the nose. The taste follows the smell closely with the hop flavor up front giving way to a light maltiness midway through and finishing off with a nice buzz on the tongue with a bit of tartness and residual sweet hop. The flavor has a little white pepper to it as well. The feel is smooth and soft with a little seltzer. It is a little sticky on the lips as well. Clearly a great NEIPA. The tartness is an interesting take on it and definitely works well. There are many other NEIPAs I would be happier to have before this one but I wouldn't kick it out of bed by any measure.  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.35

A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that smells much better than it tastes.  ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.65
92616,mactrail,2013-04-21,"   This pours a clear dark amber with an auburn cast. Not much of a head in the tall tulip glass, and below average carbonation in general. I am struggling to get much actual smell out of this, but it is powerfully hoppy-fruity in the nose and on the tongue. Rather sweet with a perfumey flavor along with the malt. Intense fruity hop flavor with some candy. Actually, it's really sweet. Dried pineapple and frozen apple juice concentrate. Some roasted malt along with all the caramel. With the right hops this could be an amber Barley Wine. Back of the throat scratchiness. A little woody and rather acidic with all the hops. Plenty of bitterness in the aftertaste. Here's yet another new brewery promising a full line of beers. They list 10 on tap already. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace on Point Loma Blvd. I wish they would lose the yellow wax dip, but that makes it ""special.""  ",3.25,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.25,3.27

58482,ChainGangGuy,2009-07-03,"   Snatched up a 4-pack of Zotten for $7.49 at Bullock's in Marietta, Georgia. I've typically enjoyed most of the Weyerbacher product I've had, so hopefully this'll hit a home run for me even if I'm not a sick, sick child dying in the hospital. Appearance: Pours out a dark, orange-amber body with a frothy, though somewhat short-lived, bone white head. Smell: Pale malts and light, crisp wheat malt brushed with a light, sweetish caramel sauce. Boldly spicy, zesty scent of fresh-ground pepper along with notes of Dubble Bubble bubblegum and citrus with some pine awakening upon warming. Taste: Pale malts and wheat coming across as a taste of particularly grainy whole wheat (but wholesome) bread. Light touch of sweet caramel glaze. Already there's a zip of peppery spiciness and flavor of bubblegum. Lesser hint of banana. Pinch of Florida orange citrus pith and a few drop of pine resin with a medium-plus amount of hop bitterness. A bit of watercress late in the taste. Dry, earthy, spicy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Drinkability: Why, that's generally likable! Plenty of flavors and complexity to keep me fairly well-entertained, but, thankfully, it's easy-going on the overall ABV. I do look forward the three remaining bottles!  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
58482,mikey711,2009-06-30,"   Poured into an oversized wine glass. A bit darker than I expected as it was amber in tint with a thick head that disappeared quickly. It smells very earthy, but still has that bubblegummy sweetness in the nose as well. Also a touch of hop spice. I think i was hoping for a bit more sourness, but this was a good effort. It is earthy and and full of esters. The mouth feel is pretty consistant with th style but it isn't going to replace any imports in this style. Also, there is a bit of a soapiness which was a bit off putting.  ",3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.64
58482,jwc215,2009-06-29,"   Poured into tulip glass: Pours golden amber with a thin white head that slowly becomes a patch. Some lacing sticks. Nice color, but doesn't have the head retention or lacing that I would expect. THe smell is of a sweet fruitiness and grainy with some yeasty notes. Slight tart notes are mixed in from the fruitiness. The taste is sweet and fruity - hint of bubblegum - that quickly turns to a dry, herbal finish. It it light-bodied. A few more effervescent bubbles would make it more lively, IMO. This is sweet and fruity/grainy turning (almost too quickly) to herbal (aspirin-y) dry. It has a certain character that gives it the ""American attempt at Belgian"". It's fine, for that.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5

58482,WVbeergeek,2009-06-27,"   Appears a beautifully clouded copper orange hue with a thick chunky doughnut like cream tinted white head, has some yeast specks floating on board. Lacing is perfect fine Belgian style lacing evenly strong around my glass. Aromatics offer up floral hops with citrus components joining in, mildly spiced yeast notes with fresh baked bread in the biscuit malt department. Very soothing and delicious smelling brew from Weyerbacher. A superb blend of flavors collide with cookie dough like malt and sweet bread layers with yeast spicing the party up a bit. Finishing with mildly earthy, pungently citric, and pleasantly floral hop additions. A bit of undeniable Belgian funk going down brings it all together. A perfect blend of spiced bready hoppy ale sits in my glass very well done the most finesse to come of Dan Weirback in some time. Mouthfeel is so smooth carbonation bubbles to tickle a bit but overall the balance of malt and hops streaks so nicely across the palate, quite the interesting medium bodied Belgian style pale. Leaves traces of yeast spice and bittering hops on the palate, and hop burps will follow and tickle the nose. Drinkability overall kicks ass one of those OMFG beers that inspires me to try as many beers as I can. A case of this is in my near future I have to sit on these and watch them evolve, the best American brewed belgian style pale to cross my palate reminiscent but by no means a copycat of Orval Trappist.  ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
58482,OldSchoolGamer,2009-06-25,"   I haven't had a lot of Belgain Pale Ales. I think the last one I had was Leffe Blonde, which I hated. Lets see if Weyerbacher can cange my perception of the style: A: Pours a nice golden straw color. Head is a bright white color, but dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is very minimal. S: Lots of Belgian yeast. Some fruityness. I also get a touch of hops. T: Pretty solid Belgian Pale Ale. First thing you get is the Belgian yeast. There is also some spice in there. Then there is a almost melon-like fruityness. The finish is grassy hops. Not bad. M: Medium to light bodied. Pretty carbonated mouthfeel. Very smooth. D: Decent flavors and mouthfeel. However, I think this is a one and done type of beer. Drinks easily, but not something I could drink a lot of. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The Belgian character is there, but there is also a unique fruit and hop character that adds to the complexity and enjoyment of the beer. Definetly worth a shot, even if you are not a Belgian Ale fan. Recommended.  ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.75
58482,magnj,2009-06-24,"   a - Somewhat hazy orange body sits below a generous film that developed after an initial 2 finger fluffly white head. s - Spicy Belgian yeast, way more up front than I was expecting, then again I don't know what exactly I was expecting. Inviting and sweet, missing the hops I was expecting but I assume that will come in the taste. t - Delicate hops flavor overshadowed by spicy Belgian yeasties. I was expecting a hop bomb from Weyerbacher but this is not it. That being said, this is a tasty brew. Sweet but not overdone, finishes clean and dry but the complex yeast flavors linger for a while. m/d - Nice and light though still a bit sweet like it's big Belgian Triple brothers. Much more refreshing but I'm still wary, I'm used to this taste having a sneaky alcohol punch to it in the end. Really drinkable, complex and a fun style I have not had much experience with.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.1

This brew does not have strong smells, but there are some light fruity Belgian fruity sents with rather strong smell of of alcohol. First taste is a generic American Belgian flavor with spicy pepper and bitterness (a bit much too) to follow. A wonderful Bready flavor follows the spice. Oddly the alcohol flavors are well controled. Medium body with some nice effervecance which highlights the pepperiness. I like the breadyness of this beer.  ",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.68

58482,BirdFlu,2009-06-19,"   Pours a copper-amber color with foamy off-white head. I was expecting it to be cloudier for some reason, nice head, though. Aroma is bready, citrusy with lemon zest and orange peel, a bit yeasty and certainly tons of banana and clove. So kind of typical. for your spiceir belgian pales.. Taste is pretty much same as aromas, yeasty, spicery with black pepper, etc. I would like it a bit sweeter. Mouth is moderate, fairly spicey with a peppery aftertaste/feel in the back of the throat. Overall its lighter in body and sessionable in that sense. The flavor is a bit off, though, and the spice is a bit much. I would enjoy it more with a bit more sweetness.  ",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.45

Lot's and lot's of yeasty sweetness. A touch of grapefruit and a slight hoppy finish. Thin mouthfeel. Not overly carbonated. Easy to drink. The thing that gets me about this ine is that it's a session beer that comes in a 4-pack. Good summer brew though. Probably not one i will try again. Not that theres anything wrong with it. This just isn't my favorite style.  ,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.65

A thick, slightly off-white cap rises and falls quickly. A small amount of sticky lace is left on the glass. A hearty Belgian yeast aroma, ripe fruits, with an herbal, medicinal hop profile and a solid bready malt. Raisins and bananas are the primary fruit. An astringent, medicinal hop profile really cuts through all of the other flavors and took me a sip or two to adjust. A signature Belgian yeast flavor of banana and an adequate amount of spice blend in with the aforementioned astringent hops and orange rind. The finish is a strong, bready malt flavor, think raisin bread. A very creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation. They nearly nailed this one. Finish is dry and bready with just a touch of bitterness. A pretty sessionable offering, easily drinkable. Would like to see it in six packs rather than four packs.

58482,vikingloki,2009-06-11,"   On tap at the Bear Creek Grille in Macungie. I'm a Weyerbacher fan, I admire and them and usually love their big beers. Comes to the table in a frosty pint glass, almost a reddish color with not much of a head, probably lost in the trip to the table. i like the color, it's a ""light foxy red"". Smells good, interesting, yeasty, bready, hoppy, complex. Taste is not what I expect - there is a very unusual, but I wouldn't say bad, kind of 'zing' thru-out, my guess is it's the yeast. Beer finishes dry with a little hop smack at the end like an afterthought. The yeasty taste lingers on the palate and to my dismay does not compliment the beer cheese dip and beer bread. I'm kinda on the fence about this one, I'd like to give it another chance sometime. Maybe having one that's been bottled in a month might mellow out that oddish tase.  ",4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.28

The nose is fruity and a little spicy. There is a nice fruit flavor in there that I cannot really pinpoint as a single fruit: just take my word for it that it is fruit. Next there is a slight peppert flavor, and maybe a touch of ansie-like flavor. There is just a touch of bready flavors from the malt. Mostly a yeast driven beer, and pretty good. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick and full. Pretty drinkable beer. I think I saw some cases for less than 40 bucks; I might go pick one up.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.97

This is an interesting beer, but I get some awful off aromas that really kill it for me. Still there's a relatively big, hoppy flavor with citrus and mild pine, while the aroma hits me with dirt and cleaning solvent - not cool.

58482,woodychandler,2009-06-10,"   An aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of rose-shaded head with good retention. Nose had a slightly perfumey accent, kind of reminiscent of Juicyfruit gum, definitely yeast-driven in its origin. The color was a hugely hazy deep-amber. The mouthfeel was full, thick, and bubbly with a very sweet bubble gum (think generic pink or Juicyfruit) flavor on the tongue. The finish lingered with that same bubble gum flavor. At 6% ABV and with its realtive lack of banana esters, I really see this as an alternative to Hefeweizen, which I dislike.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
58482,Birdiebeagle,2009-06-09,   Bottle Pours a clear goldenrod with a good off white head. The head is frothy and diminishing. Produces good lacing. Aroma is good like juicey fruit gum. Good sweet malts with a touch of hops. The taste is good. Good carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. Has a good balance of sweet and hop. Not to sweet but sweeter than hoppy. Has light to medium body. A resiny texture. The finish is good with a quality aftertaste. I love these guys beers.  ,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.25
58482,ejimhof,2009-06-08,"   About 7 0r 8 years ago I bought the Weyerbacher sampler case and sad to say I found it hard to finish. I swore I would not spend any more money on their products. Lately the beers I have tried, given to me by friends, have seemed much higher quality. I am happy to report that this may be the best beer they have made to date. It is hard to tell that this is not made in Belgium. I guess hard work and changes have paid off for this Brewery. As far as this beer they have nailed every aspect of the style. Congrats to Dan. And I am buying their beer again.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
58482,JoePetto,2009-06-07,"   On draft at TND in Wayne in 13oz wide beer flute. This is not an attempt to create a rendition of a true belgian pale ale, rather it is a ""tweener"" beer bridging the belgian and american pale ale styles. That said, this is a really enjoyable beer regardless of style. Funkiness of the Merry Monks yeast strain hits first then followed by a nice amount of hops flavor on the finish. The beer is zippy with flavor and carbonation and extremely refreshing. At 6% ABV, this beer is made to session.  ",4.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.85

Taste: 'Light hops and dirty earth' were the first things that came to mind when drinking this; it reminded me of Old Style. Mouthfeel: Considerably light carbonation - rather flat, actually. Overall: Certainly not one of the best beers I have had, let alone one of the best blondes I have had. I had this along with Brouwerij West's 'Tripel' and was excited as it was my first time trying their beers. I don't think I will be revisiting this one.  ",4.0,3.75,3.5,3.0,3.75,3.59

The aroma featured a good grain base, had a bright yeast scent, and had a bit of spiciness floating around. The flavors followed the scents pretty closely, grain, spice, and yeast, it was a pretty typical flavor profile for the style. The body was smooth and even, with a clean finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smoothly and quickly. Overall, a nice little beer, but nothing special. Worth grabbing if you see a nice price on it.  ",3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.34
64319,mhaugo,2013-07-04,"   500ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Appearance: Light butterscotch, thin white head, as cloudy as grandma’s cataract. Smell: I swear to god this smells like a skunked Corona. It’s that bottle that’s been sitting on the shelf at 7-11 for who knows how long and could not have possibly absorbed more light. Mutated, spicy noble hops. Terrible. Taste: Also tastes like bad Corona. Bad Corona that someone ran through a grain bed of pilsner malt and wheat. I almost could not finish it. Mouthfeel: Light body, medium carbonation. Overall: This brewery could not possibly ask more of me as a consumer. I heard about what they’re doing, went out and purchased a bottle of each, and will probably never buy anything else they make. I’ve been underwhelmed five times in a row. This beer may be the worst of them. I absolutely love the artwork on their labels, and the fact that they intend to rotate them, but I guess I’ll be appreciating them on the shelf going forward.  ",3.5,1.5,1.5,3.0,2.5,1.97

64319,mactrail,2013-04-26,"   A light and spritzy brew with a distinct Belgian edge. Pale hazy golden in the glass with a modest foam and adequate spritzy mouthfeel. This tastes a lot like the Swing Session Saison from Victory that I tried last night, though a little more robust. Still this is pale and light bodied with yeasty funk and more of a Brettanomyces flavor. A pleasant beery smell. Very bitter with the yeasty flavors, lasting long into the aftertaste. Quite drinkable and not overpriced. But very dry and hard edged. No trace of fruit or mellow malt in this one. Eventually this just pushes to the bitter end and I can't finish a bottle of this stuff, in spite of its virtues. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego for $5.15.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.75,3.35

It's been aging for at least 8 or 9 months, I think, so it seems somewhat mellow. Tones of lemon, though not obnoxiously so. Mild yeast and bread are also there. A nice easy drinker. Not too bad, and better than I seem to recall from the last time I tried this beer.  ",3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.69

Reviewed live. Cost was $5.99. Expectations are above average; I dig the marketing. Served straight from the refrigerator. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. A: Pours a three finger beige colour head of nice cream and thickness, and good retention - thought the ABV is merely 5.50%. Body colour is a pale yellow. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Transparent. Nonopaque. Sm: Fresh clean pale malts. Lemongrass. Lemon zest. Citrus zest. A clean appealing aroma for the style. Little yeast. No alcohol is detectable. An average strength aroma. A bit adulterated. Artificial floral notes. Artificial lime. A bit reminiscent of a crappy Spanish lager. T/Mf: Artificial crappy lime up front immediately. A clean malt and decent zesty lemon body. Comes off artificial and a bit syrupy. No yeast or alcohol comes through. Very strange for the style. A bit garbage. I don't care much for it. It's certainly not well balanced. Overly malty. Poorly built for the style. Dr: Drinkable but underwhelming and overpriced. Very forgettable. Beneath pedestrian. Why brew this?

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and some slight skunk which is weird because the bottle is brown. The smell reminds me more of a foreign lager than a Belgian style pale ale. Fortunately, the taste is much better with malt, grain, yeast, and some spice flavors on the finish. I am also picking up some grassy and herbal flavors as the beer warms up a bit. There is a medium spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that walks an interesting balance of having a mediocre smell but a great taste.  ",4.0,3.0,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.91

The nose is a tad funky with some lemony esters joining in. The taste is refreshing with a dry, straw-like character and a slight phenolic finish. Brain is devoted to recreating Belgian flavors and I would not think this was a West Coast beer. The mouthfeel is ample and creamy. Quite enjoyable if you enjoy old world styles.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

64319,jminsc76,2011-05-03,"   On tap presently at The Library in Santa Monica. Pours a white frothy head atop a yellow, golden body. A highly effervescent look with pretty bubbles rising and dancing upon agitation. The bouquet is highly floral, with strong wheat aromas and mild lavender. More or less it's like smelling a White Orchard from The Bruery, though slightly less floral, with more wheat and yeast. Flavors are yeasty, much like the aromas, much like White Orchard, though smoother and with substantial meat behind it. It’s almost as if I am chewing on the wheat, with a highly complex, smooth, dry heartiness that makes it so pleasant. Which leads me to the… …mouthfeel, which is dry and ebullient upon swishing, and very clean. Overall, this is damn good, maintaining high drinkability both from its flavors, mouthfeel, and excellent crispness. Ideal for pairing with food (thinking a good salad with some goat cheese or a fish dish) as well as a standalone sipping aperitif. Easily could I throw back two or three per sitting.  ",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.3
64319,DoubleJ,2011-04-25,"   On-tap at Beachwood BBQ, on to the beer: Pale yellow in color with little head retention on top. The aroma is difficult to make out; it smells most like a barnyard. A little sulfur make way. I thought the funk would lighten up from there, but it keeps going strong into the taste. From the taste, I could close my eyes and pretend I was on a farm. In fact, it seems to resemble a saison better than a Belgian Blond. At some points it's pushing itself to being uncomfortable, though I find a way enjoy it. This is definately not for the faint of heart.  ",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.37
64319,beagle75,2011-04-23,"   Draft service into a long-stemmed fluted tulip glass at Beachwood BBQ. A: Slightly hazy, medium golden color with one finger of fine white foam head. No lacing remains on the glass, although a few submerged and clustered bubbles cling to the side. S: Toasted grain and clean but characterful Belgian yeast present a smell that is slightly spicy and herbaceous, but otherwise clean. T: Begins almost dry, with bright fruit consisting of pear and golden raisin alongside estery farmhouse yeast. Acidity is managed well, remaining restrained but lively. Delicate pale malt emerges in the middle as flavors of malt and yeast turn bready. The finish is mild and yeasty, seeing a tasteful and palate-cleansing resurgence of acidity. M: Thin to medium viscosity, refreshing on the palate, early acidity is not quite felt, with moderate carbonation. D/O: This is an unassuming beer of ordinary strength and intensity that delivers Belgian-style character in exactly the expected quantity. Comparable to Russian River Redemption, it lacks the extreme dryness and blanketing wheat-like quality of that other beer. It is a bit limp to look at, in a way that Russian River beers almost never are, but otherwise it makes for a worthy saison/single cross-over.  ",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.77

Aroma is sweet and boozy, later becoming a little more earthy and woody at room temperature. Initially it's like sniffing a pour of Buffalo Trace. Taste has more nuance, though still plenty of whiskey heat packed in. Woody drying aftertaste, much like a sip of bourbon. Middle has notes of earthy roasted malt, toffee, caramel, toasted almond, dry tobacco leaves. Chewy and rich, but not without some sting and numbing alcohol.

Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon.  ",3.75,4.5,4.25,3.5,4.0,4.16

Couldn't find any info on the thirsty dog website about the beer, but it isn't their advertised as their normal berliner. The bar is a legit craft haven in the area so I trust it wasn't a mistake. It had a dry hay and orange peel nose, the tart is gentle but noticeable with the citrus carrying through. The big thing is that it is very creamy and velvety feel, with a vanilla orangcicle flavor, which I assume comes from the barrel aging. Have not had the regular Berliner from them so nothing to compare it to, but this version was excellent  ",,,,,,4.54

Has a nice spiced fruit aroma to it, with the camomille sticking out, but also some coriander and decent floral notes.

47792,IBUnit63,2009-02-07,"   Into a pint glass we go. This pours much like a Belgian pale...1 1/2-finger head with solid lacing. Body is very light lemon-honey and with a little bit of cloud cover. Of course this is extremely floral, fruity and calming. The chamomile is definitely the master of this domain. There's a fair amount of tropical (and other) fruits here - cantaloupe, a bit of pear, too...and a little papaya? The hop bitterness can best be described as Saaz-ish...tight and a little piney. The chamomile has that nighttime herbal tea quality to it - it's pretty hardcore in a cask. I wonder if the chamomile lends itself better to a regular cold tap - it gets a little thick after a while. Palate feel is very sweet and tight, with a heavy wallop of bitterness from the chamomile husks. Pretty hefty. Yup - this is OK but I think in a regular tap it would do better - chamomile on cask is a little over the top. Interesting pour though.  ",,,,,,3.65

Poured into a clear balloon snifter. A - Pours a finger and a half of soft fluffy soapy khaki head on top of a bright burnt sienna orange colored body with some ruby red highlights when held to the light. Scattered lacing. Looks very nice. S - Smell is of bright juicy floral & tropical hops, grass, some cream, some soapiness, red / amber malt, caramel, faint molasses / brown sugar, and a hint of alcohol. T - Taste is of big bitter grapefruit hops, peppery rye, caramel / amber malt, some brown sugar sweetness, and some dirty herbal earthiness. M - Feel goes down smooth and clean, with some herbal grapefruit hop bitterness clinging to the palate. Medium full body with good carbonation. Overall, another nice beer from Spiteful Brewing. These guys haven't let me down yet, and by the looks of things, it seems like I'm going to have to try some more of their beers. These local Chicago breweries have really been doing great things lately. Spiteful Brewing Negative Nancy ---4/5.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
106164,bpgpitt10,2013-12-19,"   A: Great red color. Served with a nice two finger white head that leaves lacing and is downright thick. Not sure what else I could ask for. S: Malt with some spice to it. Citrus that is totally on the lemon side rather than orange/grapefruit/mango. T: Mild sweetness that is balanced with the lemon coming through on the palate. Really low overall residual bitterness. The more I drink it, the more the bitter hangs around a little. It's not overpowering at all though. Light alcohol burn at the end... not necessarily bad though. M: Medium. Maybe a little on the light side. Nothing to write home about. O: Solid beer that I'd have another one of. It doesn't do anything amazing, but it's a solid offering and worth a try.  ",5.0,4.0,3.5,2.75,3.5,3.64

84394,drabmuh,2012-09-14,"   Served on draft at CK, served in a snifter, reviewed from notes. This beer is odd to put it politely, to be less polite, it spent enough time in the barrel to remove any interesting hop character but not long enough to pick up a lot of barrel character, the resulting beer is a dull bland shadow of an IPA that I completely don't understand as a beer. Beer is orangish with a mild haze and some wispy head, mostly clear, looks like beer. Aroma is mildly oaky, some whiskey / booze. Beer is light in body and finishes a little dry with minimal bitterness and some liquor / alcohol / oakiness up front. There is no tannic character to the beer and the overall is just a disappointment. Maybe I just don't like barrel aged IPAs but I have yet to have one that I thought, ""Yeah, this did improve the beer."" IPAs are one of those beers that is close to impossible to improve through the exposure to time, oxygen, and wood. Not saying it cannot be done but this is yet another example in a growing postulate of mine that this is not likely to yield good results. Not a repeat for me.  ",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.18

84394,kylehay2004,2012-08-15,"   Single finger head on a clear deep golden body. Some lacing. Mild hops, mostly citrus and metallic notes with oak on the nose. The flavor is interesting with the oak mixing with earthy and metallic hops making a very herbal flavor. Sounds confusing but that's how this beer went. Medium body ad moderate carbonation. Never had a sessioned IPA barrel aged. Unique making it a must try. I am guessing te ABV listed for this one was off a bit but it was advertised at 4.5.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.05

A: Pours a very cloudy, bright, light orange color with a one inch head, good retention, and robust lacing. S: The fragrance reaches out to the nose from a distance while decanting. Aromas of mango, orange, pineapple, and peach predominate. Pepper/pine/spice notes. T: Largely follows the nose with flavors of peach and orange dominant. Bitterness kicks in slowly, leading to a refreshing finish. M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Creamy and smooth.

125646,HankSingle,2017-10-26,"   Goodness, me. A gift from a friend, just back from Western MA. I thought it looked a little light - a beautiful, bright, luminous light orange, hazy as the name suggests, but it seemed pale for the stats. Everything else, though. Ripping fruits on the nose, this drinks like the most perfectly balanced mimosa - fresh squeezed orange juice and kinetic effervescence...it's impossible to connect this beer with its alcohol content until after you've finished it, it is just so light, and so lovely. Soft and creamy on the tongue, it leaves the exactly perfect trail of crisp bitterness on the release. I loved this beer, very close to the best one I've ever had, I think. I was shattered when it was gone.  ",4.75,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.99

125646,Holderness,2017-10-26,"   Canned 12 days ago. L — See: Name S — Orange, cream, chalky yeastiness, mango, guava, and, interestingly, a touch of spirulina/chlorella T — Peach and orange dominate the palate. Reminds me more of Julius than Green, but has less of that orange creamsicle quality. Also getting pineapple, papaya, mango, and white bready malts F — Smooth, gently creamy, fluffy texture. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Immensely smooth and drinkable for the ABV. Practically no bitterness, save for a slight tea-like quality between sip and finish. Semi-sweet O — Even though it doesn’t quite top the perfection that is Julius/Green, this is still my favorite DIPA to date. I simply cannot believe that this is 8.2% ABV. Drinking blind, I would guess 5.5% 94/100 EDIT(9/13/18): 2-week-old can. Reaffirming all above notes. It is so hard to not chug this. Straight peach juice  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.68

63496,Onenote81,2010-11-13,"   Stopped in here with the family for lunch before we headed to Pilot Mt State Park. I've been here in the past and they haven't had any beer at the time. Used to just have 2 offerings. They now have 4, all of which were on tap. I ordered this one as I am a sucker for IPAs. The bartendress wasn't sure if this was an American or English style. I labelled it American from the hop profile. Came out a very dark rusty copper color with a thin white head on it. Little retention, but there were many pretty sip rings left after each sip. The nose was pretty basic with some floral tones and a sharp hoppy scent. Decent body on this one. Moderate carbonation. Good depth. Wonderful bitter hops all over this one. Some faint orange sweetness, grass, and more hops. This one is a hop-head beer for sure. Wasn't sure what to expect from this little place, but if this is any indication of what the rest of their lineup is like, I'll be back to try the rest. Good beer.  ",,,,,,3.73
58482,Gavage,2009-06-05,"   Appearance: orange in color with some yellow highlights. A one finger head lingers around a while. Smell: bread and a spicy yeast aroma is very pleasant on the nose. Taste: bready caramel base with a very spicy yeast flavor that comes through quite strongly. Bitterness is a bit mild, and there is a soft fruit sweetness in the background. Mouthfeel: lightly crisp throughout. Medium bodied. Aftertaste is long as the yeast spiciness lingers in the mouth. Drinkability: this beer went down quite easily and after the second glass, I could have had another. Nice new addition to the regular lineup.  ",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.15
58482,ATPete,2009-06-02,"   12oz bottle Pours a hazy yellow color with a medium sized white head. Lots of banana in the aroma right from the get go, bready yeast, clovey wheat beer like spice and a mild dosage of hops. Good flavor, definitely Belgian inspired, i like the serious malt structure here, bready again with just enough sweetness to match. IMO this beer needs more hops, i know they are going for a balanced Belgian/American Pale Ale here but a little added bitterness and crispness from another peppering of hops wouldnt hurt this beer any. None the less another solid offering from Weyerbacher and one im glad to have year round. The artwork and package design is great as well, i think this is the visual direction Weyerbacher needs to take in order to put their beer in more peoples hands.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.6
58482,yen157,2009-05-27,"   Honey orange with yellow flashes. Not much head, though a creamy collar remains. Bright, lively nose with big banana, clove phenol, and breadiness reminiscent of raw pizza dough. Flavors follow in lockstep with the nose except that it is punctuated by a pleasant tart yeast character and balanced by mineral water and New World hoppiness, all in bittering and flavor as well as some bubblegum late into the finish. I made the mistake drinking this out of the fridge too cold. Breadiness came out as it warmed. Overall, very good. It does a great job filling the niche of something interesting and sessionable that's not a lager or basic pale.  ",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.95
58482,tpd975,2009-03-27,"   A: Pours a slightly cloudy deep piss yellow hue. The head was huge at least 4 fingers in height. The retention was just as ridiculous. Tons of extra thick foam clings to the glass to form 3D lacing. S: Nice light belgian aromas. Light banana with subtle hints of spice. Yeast dominates, but there are nice bready notes as well. T: Very similar to aroma but a bit more bold. Nice Banana like Belgian yeast. Bread, with notes of pepper and clove. M: Medium in body, pretty smooth with great carbonation....almost too much. D: Not bad, the folks in Belgium won't be doing back flips over this one, but it is pretty tasty nonetheless.  ",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.68
58482,mikereaser,2009-02-06,"   A - pours a murky orange color with 1/4 inch of foam S - not a whole of aroma, some bananas, floral hops T - again, bananas, bready flavor, with a little bit of floral hop M/D - really dry finish, but nice carbonation. A bit tart to me, not my favorite.  ",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.35
58482,akorsak,2008-11-23,"   A 12 oz bottle from the Riserva release last summer. A: The ale is a brilliant, bright golden color, crystal clear save for the stream of bubbles in the center of the glass. A half a finger of head almost spilled out over the glass. S: The aroma is strong, even from an arm's length the Belgian scents are strong. Candi sugars, pepper and dry fruity yeast are all strong. T: Wow! This ale is intensely dry. The yeast strain has done its job and stripped all of the sugars out of this beer. Pepper is strong, tempering the ale with a pleasant heat. The remnants of candi sugar swirl around near the end of each sip. Pale grains add a caramel flavor and a nice dose of citrusy hops is not too strong. The ale is very similar to Orval, save for the lack of brett. M: The mouthfeel is very crisp, clean and sharp with a constant stream of carbonation to keep things jumping. D: A nice one-off offering that, at least for me, got lost behind Thirteen and Riserva.  ",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,4.05
58482,SaCkErZ9,2008-11-16,"   Thanks to Risser09 for this one. Pours from a 12oz bottle into a pilsner glass. SLightly cloudy golden orange color with a stiff and tall white head. Rocky, dense, and massive. Tons of lacing and the head lasts for the duration of consumption. Aroma is slightly subdued. Certainly some belgian sugars, a touch of yeast. Slight earthy hop aroma. Perhaps some spicy corriander or black pepper. Sweet upfront with a sweet hop bite in the back. Belgian sugars. Ends with a different, sweet fruitiness typical in a Tripel. Distinct hop bite in the finish. Finishes really dry and crisp. Somewhat oily as well. I actually enjoyed this one. Seems like it may be an American interpretation as the hops seem to be non tradtional and more citrusy (read: west coast USA). I really liked this, alot. Thanks again to Risser09 for this one.  ",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.01
58482,orbitalr0x,2008-10-06,"   12oz bottle. Excited to give this a try. Pours into my glass a hazy yellow orange with a billowing bubbly white head on top. Lots of active carbonation. Aromas start out with sweet pale grain malts along with some banana and spice with a bold clove accent. Belgian yeast as well. Rather mellow. First sip brings a crisp light grain malt upfront that carries with it some sweetness. Some banana and fruit accents follow along with a spiciness of clove and light pepper. Finishes with a touch of Belgian yeast and lingering sweetness. Overall it is just not cohesive and ends up being rather bland. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with an onslaught of fast moving carbonation. The excess carbonation gets in the way and knocks down my enjoyment of the brew. Overall, I'm really not digging this brew. It falls somewhat flat flavor wise and ends up being rather boring. Thanks to afterexile for the opportunity to try it.  ",4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.91
58482,PittBeerGirl,2008-08-11,   A- This is a beautiful Belgian Pale. Body is a cloudy pale yellow that is served with a 1-2 finger white foamy head. The head eventually settles down to &lt;1/2 finger and retains this well. Cloudiness is thick and uniform. S- Lots of banana and floral hops come to the nose. Thats about all I was able to gather. T- This is pretty heavy on banana (for the style) upfront. A very perfume-like funky flavor is also present that I can't put my finger on. This all has a moderate yeast backbone and spices added. A little bit of floral hop bitterness comes through for the finish and not much lingers on. M- Weyerbacher did a great job with the mouthfeel. Low-Medium carbonation with a smooth yeasty body. D- This is a decent Pale Ale that is pretty easy to drink. Its strength is definitely the mouthfeel. Definitely not my favorite of the style but a decent example.  ,4.5,3.5,3.0,4.5,3.5,3.46

58482,Gueuzedude,2008-08-09,"   Quite aromatic smelling as I pour this beer; I get layers of fruit and vibrant spice. A soft pour yields a four-finger thick, light tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is a bright, amber color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, copper color when held up to the light. Aromas of ripe pears, sweet plums and aromatic apples mix with spice notes of big clove and light pepper. Towards the finish some notes of thin, fermented grape juice aromas start to come through; a touch tart, almost cider like and with a mineral, almost metallic edge. A touch of dusty malt towards the finish helps to round things out a bit. An interesting aroma that accentuates fruit and lots of clove. Lightly sweet with a mix of apple and some huge, phenolic driven clove flavors up front. The beer is quite well carbonated, which contributes to a definite fizzy texture as it flows across the tongue. The finish has quite a bit of sharp phenolic notes to it, leaning towards clove but with a touch of a harsher edge and something a bit like cola. Underneath the omnipresent phenolics is a touch of fresh grain character, some soft fruity esters (that the clove notes seem to make cidery at times) and some spicy higher alcohols. Pretty light bodied, though not thin, the carbonation definitely helps with the perceived lightness as well. Definitely characterful for a Belgian Pale Ale. It can be a bit too phenolic at times as the Clove character is a bit dominating. Not bad though.  ",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.7
58482,OWSLEY069,2008-08-08,"   Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color, with a off white head. In the aroma, candy sugar, and green apple. In the taste, sugary, green apples, and green grapes. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Good, but a bit sweeter than expected, and a nice small tart fruit note.  ",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.55
58482,marcpal,2008-06-25,"   12oz bottle with an ugly, oldschool label that shows this is a one-off brew. Loved this beer at the event a few weeks back and was unhappy only to grab the last few bottles left for sale and would've loved more. Just hope this one starts getting mass produced. The first low abv WB brew that has really blown me away. A: Clear gold, looks like a Belgian- almost the appearance of Duvel hue without the monster head. Still ample foam and spidery lacing that doesnt go anywhere fast. N: Spices, coriander, orange rind, lemon rind. Grassy, hoppy notes a bit biting. Clearly has doughy flavors coming my way and banana yeasts. T: Complexity for the low alcohol- sweetness, fruitiness, hops and spices all take their turns. Stronger flavor profile warmed down a bit. Little bit of dishwasher detergent, but oddly not in a bad way. M: Spices dominate like a good Belgian. Full, doughy and chewy. D: At 6.2%, could drink this all day in any season. Refreshing and tasty- would love to see this one replace House, Muse, Scotch or one of their other more ""session"" oriented beers. Many dont rave about this one, but I do.

It is a very unusual taste, color and feel for a beer. First the color/look - pale yellow color, but the yeast leaves it cloudy and there looked to be chunks as you poured it in the glass. Taste wise it was kind of a blend between a Belgian Pale and a wheat beer. Feel - it was a beer you felt like you were chewing it. Usually, I like the warm of a cask style beer, but in this case think it tasted better after I put the growler in the fridge for the second night. My recommendation - definitely try a glass of this beer when you get a chance since it is so different though not positive you will like it enough to try a second, but you will be able to say you had a ""firkin"".  ",4.5,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.23

S - Here is where the Belgian yeast starts to show itself. Bubble gum and some citrus with a definite hop presence. T - To me this beer doesn't quite know it's place in the world. It's got some of the ""wheatiness"" of a wit as well as some of the ""bubble gum"" noted in the smell, but an American hop profile. Pleasant, but not something I'd go out of my way for. M - Medium bodied with low carbonation. The fact that this comes from a firkin has a lot to do with this. D - Pleasant. Not bad at all, not great, but pleasant. Certainly an interesting interpretation of a style underrepresented in this area.  ",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.35

Taste follows the nose with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, orange blossom honey providing a touch of sweetness. Bit of a rindy bitterness that is cut with the sweetness.

104824,Karl_M,2014-04-24,"   Can I say, ""Fuck you, Goose Island""? Just curious. If you don't get your tounge wet with this brew, then you have not had the best bourbon barrel aged stout ever. Vanilla bitterness and cacao darkness blanket this milk stout with the rounding out needed when in the presence of the blessed bourbon sweetness that comes from a freshly emptied cask. The lack of fizz upon pouring and subsequent headless beer in my mug of 5000-mile-old motor oil had me wondering if I'd recieced a dud and dude, it was not a dud. Let me tell you... The carbonation was felt on my tounge from the first heavenly sip through the last savory drop. The words I have cannot describe the decadent internal bliss that is swelling inside me. Batch 209.  ",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
104824,timc100,2014-04-23,"   Batch 209 - Big, bold, imperial stout - very dark, mocha head, thin barrel-charred lacing. Incredibly pronounced note of raw bourbon - caramel and booze. Other barrel notes of char, oak, vanilla as well as incredibly dark, bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee. The finish is spectacular - very strong, as if it actually gets bigger. Fresh from the oak - this is very barrel forward with tons of whiskey, and in every way fantastic.  ",4.5,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.47

104824,blankenhoney,2014-04-06,"   12oz bottle from PW batch #75. Pours very dark with a light frothy head; looks kind of like a glass of cola. On the nose is pungent alcohol, baker's chocolate, and notable sweetness. Taste is rich and intense: bourbon-soaked raisins and dates, creamy chocolate, and lots of burnt brown sugar. But the barrel character tends to overwhelm those more subtle flavors. It's a milk stout, so mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not too thin: smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, this one suffers from the overpowering barrel character, and all the flavors of the original Jones Dog get snuffed out rather than enhanced.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.75,3.62

It didn't explode out but it came in a pretty solid initial flow then continued to bubble for some time. A - A deep golden with a very hazy finish and a big white head (bordering on too big). S - Lots of contributions from the wheat with a grassy, lemony aroma. T - Crisp, clean and dry. Maybe a bit too dry. Nice flavors from the wheat with a slightly tart finish. The maple syrup is faint but contributes. M - A moderate consistency with a high carbonation giving it a lively feel. O - Very refreshing. Between the foam-over and dryness, I think this one over attenuated in the bottle but it was good.  ",3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.6

Some patchy lace sticks to the glass and overall the brew is pretty nice looking. The aroma is grainy wheat with grass and sulfur notes. A little fruity to floral aspect in the back. The nose is pretty simple but clean and enjoyable. The flavor is lightly fruity almost with a hint of something like cider. Some wheat and sulfur are also thrown in there. A faint watered down with a hint of something like earthy maple syrup in the aftertaste. This is a light bodied brew with an effervescent amount of carbonation. A strange and unique combo of character. The fruity apple notes were not expected and didnt quite work.  ,4.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.48

92742,TheManiacalOne,2013-05-26,"   On-tap 3/15/2013 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI, served in a weizen glass. A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. S: The aroma is very faint but contains caramelized malts, some hops and some citrus. T: The taste starts out bready with a hearty but not too heavy malt character. Then some mildly sweet flavors of caramel and citrus come in. The hops presence is decent in strength, distinctly German and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly bready and slightly hoppy. M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean. O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to pound down for a very long time.  ",4.0,3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,3.97
92742,Flounder57,2013-05-11,"   Having on draft at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth. Appearance: This beer poured a small head that reduced to a small layer. It is a thick looking golden straw yellow that looks similar to their hefeweizen. Nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank. Smell: cloves, bready malts, bananas, and some sweet malts. Taste: Same as above with mild hoppy flavor and bitterness to the beer. Its just a hoppier version of their hefeweizen. Picking up a little citrus and pine in there. Interesting. Mouthfeel: Smooth, full bodied, low to medium carbonation, a little chewy, and a little hop bitterness too. Overall: This beer should be categorized as a hefeweizen, but this one is hoppier than their normal version. Still very tasty.  ",4.25,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.02

92742,ThePorterSorter,2013-04-24,"   On tap @ the Blue Monk in Buffalo The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with 1/2 an inch of a fluffy white head that fades quickly and laces. The nose is a sweet honey forward, wheat/corn, yeast, hops (slightly citrusy), and a hint of bubble gum. The taste presents much the same with malty/honey sweetness upfront that becomes more of a banana bread/ripe pear sweetness as it warms, and is carried on by a residual citrusy sweetness...still no true hop presence. It's light-medium bodied, effervescent, easy drinking, slightly yeasty, obviously sweet, sort-of hoppy, but nothing I'd classify as being ""bitter."" This is a slight push towards being a hoppy lager, but I'm unimpressed by the attempt.  ",4.25,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.96

125646,braker649er,2017-10-21,"   What beautiful beer! L: The name calls it. Lovely orange-cold, thick as juice and cloudy as glacial runoff. S: There's orange but also tropical fruit. I picked up a pine scent similar to how the pith of a mango has pine. T: Juice comes first and... wow! What took me by surprise is that the malt is detectable, too. F: Just so damned smooth. Again, like glacial runoff, but juicy instead. O: Worth seeking this out via a trade. Poured from a can to a tulip glass. Had side-by-side with Spirit Crusher, a similarly hazy DIPA from Seattle's Holy Mountain. Also from a can created about the same time! An interesting East-West experiment with both winning, in my opinion. The New England beer predictably nailed its own style with the aptly named Haze. And the West-coast brew brought Washington state hops to the table in a very similar style. I'd say Spirit Crusher might've been even more orange-juicier, just in the way that it was more like orange-juice concentrate. Maybe more hop bite, too. Like tasting a hop off the vine. ""Haze"" may have been slightly more refined, which is odd to say because both have punch and smoothness. Balance. And surprisingly similar beers!  ",4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.63

97487,maximum12,2013-10-19,"   Thanks to damienblack for this bottle among other eastern treasures; wanted this one the moment I heard about it. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. The pour, conducted expertly by my 11 year old daughter, is fraught with overcarbonation. Head overtops the two goblets & gets all over my poor daughter, who now smells like beer. Hope the child welfare people don’t stop by. Nose is wheat &…funk? Funk. Not sour, more like saison-level funk. Not liking where this starts up. Lawson’s Maple Wheat is half right, at least. No hint of maple anywhere in the near vicinity. Overwhelming dint of funkiness slashed, but not enough, with grain & raw wheat. The effect is something of a cross between Jolly Pumpkin & a traditional hefe - & it’s not good. The stupid carbonation inhibits what enjoyment I might have been able to pull out of this; 11 ounces is far too much. I can’t believe this was the brewer’s intent. Funk, overcarbonation, missing maple all point to the start of an infection, or something unpleasant. Perhaps my first bad beer from Lawson’s. A drain pour disappointment.  ",2.0,2.5,2.0,1.5,1.5,1.97

Very similar to the aroma, clove, slight banana, wheat is present, slight yeast characteristic, very light, cannot pick out any maple notes, its refreshing.

Looks viscous. Great aroma. It's smells like s'mores... Graham cracker, chocolate, toasted marshmallow. Heavy oak and vanilla characteristics. BT is my go to bourbon so I'm excited for the taste. It doesn't disappoint. Heavy vanilla and chocolate. Char to a lesser extent. Woody, toffee, molasses. It pulls the heavy spicy rye characteristic and displays it in a long finish. Heavy and lingering sweetness in the mouthfeel. Boozy but smooth. Well done. Dispute the price tag I'm glad it's a 12oz serving. It's quite filling but delicious.  ",4.0,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.3

Huge barrel character. Bourbon. Some chocolate and a bit of molasses and caramel behind it. Taste - Again, it's almost all barrel. Oak and a sharp bourbon flavor. The bourbon flavor never diminishes, although the oak flavor comes back in the end with a bite. Molasses more prominent with some dark chocolate that never reaches the fudge-y heights of Game of Jones. A little bit of lactose sweetness lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel - Booze and barrel all over this. Medium-low carbonation. A sipper for sure. Overall - If you like bourbon-dominated beers, this is for you. If you like to taste the beer back there, this is not for you. I happen to really like bourbon, although I think I would prefer to drink it straight over this.  ",3.0,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.56

104824,mfnmbvp,2014-03-12,"   12 oz. bottle, with handwritten Batch #75 on the label. Ah yes, at long last I have finally acquired one of these elusive barrel aged Pipeworks offerings. The label lists this as Tales From The Oak - The Jones Dog. ""Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with cacao and vanilla added"". My expectations are interstellar; Pipeworks makes some of my favorite stouts. It's probably gonna be pretty epic. Poured into a clear balloon snifter. A - Straight pour down the center produces no head, just a few mocha bubbles. Body is a dark woodsy mahogany-cola color; just a few shades away from black. Some sticky alcohol lacing when given a swirl in the glass. Looks very nice. S - Ah yes, this thing smells truly amazing. I would dare to say this smells nearly as good as Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, if maybe a touch boozier. Bourbon booze heat, woodsy barrel character, creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate, cookie dough, & hints of tart rum soaked dark fruit. T - Absolutely delicious; everything I hoped it would be. Smooth creamy vanilla, fudgey chocolate / cacao, roasted coffee bean bitterness, earthy / woodsy barrel character, bourbon alcohol heat, caramel / toffee, and some hints of dark boozy fruit (raisin, date, plum, green apple). Delicious. M - Feel is silky smooth and creamy. Sticky & sugary - it would make an ideal dessert beer. Full bodied with extremely low lying carbonation. Moderately high 11.00% abv is mildly apparent, but tolerable. Overall, it was nothing short of delicious, however I think Pipeworks is capable of making even better barrel aged stouts than this. There is no telling what amazing things these guys will do in the future. Definitely one of my favorite Pipeworks beers I've had the privilege of drinking, and probably the best of their stouts so far. One of my favorite beers from one of my favorite breweries. Highly recommended, I can't wait to get more of these. Pipeworks Barrel Aged Imperial Jones Dog ---4.5/5  ",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.79

The taste was offered grainy malts, a grassy hop and delicate ester. The mouthfeel was typical of the style. Overall a tasty ale.  ",,,,,,3.53

Smells of fuzzy kiwi skin, pale malt, light basement must, lactic sourness and a bit of sweetness. Taste is pretty bright kiwi initially quickly being joined by the dulled must, malt and sourness combo. Tart feel with plenty of lingering dryness. Overall a pretty solid sour ale. I get plenty of kiwi and it is definitely not a mouth destroyer which is A-OK in my book. Definitely worth a pour if you are into sours.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.97

Flavors are malt forward with both pale and caramel malts coming through. Hops more on the pine resin end with subtle sweet citrus notes. Nitro with medium body. It's not a bad beer just not very exiting. The hops used were cascade and legacy. Worth trying.  ",,,,,,3.81

Walnuts, chocolate, coffee and a tinge of booze. My goodness, immediately catapulted to the top of my favorite stout list. The walnuts, coffee and chocolate and playing games with me. I think I may fall over. Here comes some smoke. Then tobacco. This gets better with every sip. Thick and oily. I don't want it to leave. It is as proper as a stout could feel. Wonderful.

There really isn't a lot of visible carbonation here. This leaves the glass oily and slick. The aroma is incredibly nice. There's plenty of dark roasted malt character, sweet vanilla and whipped cream, mild coffee, and nut character. Complete and decadent. The flavor, too, is stunning. It's rich, roasty, creamy, and complex (earth, vanilla, whipped cream, and nut). The flavors are well integrated and the alcohol is well hidden though not completely masked. Very nice. Medium to full bodied with very low carbonation. Creamy and incredibly drinkable. Simply fantastic.  ",3.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,5.0,4.49

Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, nuts, sweet vanilla, and wood. Taste is exactly the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great aromas and flavors.  ",3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.34

You can taste the hoppiness of this beer without a major bite. It's really enjoyable Feel- carbonation and fullness really shine. Tree house is known for creaminess. This may be the best they offer in this regard. Overall- a real sleeper. Very drinkable. The feel as good as anything out there. Just quality.

Lacking in any sort of yeasty aromatics even though they call it a Hefeweizen; correctly categorized as an American Pale Wheat. The mouthfeel is crisp and feather light. It could have more carbonation for a near flavorless beer. This is more promising than the couple of other brews I've had from this place. Not much to brag about, though it's a perfectly gulpable beverage if you like the kiss of fruit. Current version in the 12 oz can is 5% ABV.

125814,Lone_Freighter,2017-06-20,"   Poured into a weizen glass, the appearance was a soft semi-burnt bronzed golden color that had about a two and a half finger's worth of white foamy head that slid off at a moderate pace. Some speckled lace ran here and there, somewhat clingy but also sliding at the same time. The aroma shaped some super light banana esters against the normal clove spices, but seemed to come across somewhat light. Light bubblegum and sweet wheat slide in for a decent blend. The flavor was moderately sweet through the bubblegum, banana esters and sweet wheat. But once again, not very bold as I would have hoped for. Aftertaste had a touch of the sweet wheat and bubblegum. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt a bit more prickly than expected. The clove spice even had a bit more of unxexpected harshness to me. ABV did feel appropriate. Overall, not a Weihenstephaner in any sense, but somewhat worthy, perhaps. Maybe again for me.  ",3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.49

Thick frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving a residual thin layer of foam and lots of sticky white lacing behind. For the NE style IPA this is an excellent appearance. Smell is pungent and permeating - strong notes of orange, tangerine, peach, mango and passionfruit all are noted. Taste follows the nose with lots of strong citrus flavors - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - along with some peach and mango initially. Quickly transitions to some English biscuit like malt, some grassy hop notes, and dry hopped flavors. Almost no bitterness although you certainly get lots of hops flavors. Feel is medium to full bodied, thick, yet extremely drinkable. Moderate carbonation is perfect for the heft of this beer. Smooth dry finish. Overall this is a fantastic NE style IPA from Tree House. Certainly lives up to the expectations.  ",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.53

Aromatics are lush with fresh peach and orange sherbet. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Peaches, orange, and candied grapefruit on the palate. Minimal bitterness, zero malt, and quite dry. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit. Great beer.

A violent pour yielded a huge bright white head; thick, frothy lace. Peach & pine notes in the nose. Sticky medium mouthfeel. Pine & peach flavors up front; a tangy bite on the finish.

Taste is similarly fruity, peach, mango, and passionfruit with a dry and resiny bitter grapefruit peel finish. Light bodied with a soft but lean feel.

Pours a clear, pale golden color, with a one and a half inch head and some soapy lacing. Smells of Citra and Mosaic hops- grapefruit, orange, some pine, a little lime, light malt and yeast. A little dank. The taste is a little more Mosaic than Citra- pine, resin, grapefruit, orange, lemon, light lime, a little melon, malt. A good amount of bitterness throughout, and again, a little dank. Smooth, well carbonated, a good body. There’s no doubt this is all about the Citra and Mosaic. Really good flavor, good aroma, an easy drinker.  ",3.75,4.0,4.25,4.0,4.0,4.09

Overall: Great IPA. The hop bill is nothing new, but the malt/rye backbone sets it apart from the standard West Coast style IPA. I had this from a freshly tapped keg and was blown away.

This one goes down easy with big points in the drinkability column. Hoppiness really comes through - IPA yes. Have had other ryes in the past where the rye really dominates. While I like that extreme, not really getting that here, though the beer is quite good. Carbonation is just north of mild.

The aroma was a very nicely balanced blend of grain and hops that, while distinct, melded together nicely. Sadly, there was just a slight bit of cattiness that I found a bit off-putting. On the tongue however, the beer was all full, earthy grains and crisp hops that complemented each other very nicely indeed. The beer had a bit of a tart hop finish that lingered for a few moments. No sign of the kitty. The body was nicely medium, very smooth, easy and crisp. Drinkability was excellent, you could drink these all afternoon long and not get fatigued or bored.

197154,dd43,2015-12-27,"   I think this particular style is not well understood by a lot of beer drinkers. As the name suggests, this is a beer built to be paired with a midday meal. Per the style, it is low on carbonation, is decidedly malty, not overly pronounced hop bitterness, and easy to drink in terms of relatively low ABV. Pours with almost no head, which is understandable given how low the carbonation level is. Color of iced tea, and similarly hazed. Aroma is not pungent, but rather sweetly malty, like a lightly sweet biscuit or sweetened bread crust. Definitely a grain forward beer, flavor wise as well. Bready notes throughout, like whole wheat bread. Really pleasant to drink, no booze notes whatsoever. Goes down quickly and easily, the perfect libation to quench one's parchment after a hearty traditional english lunch of meat cheese and bread. Cheers!  ",4.0,3.75,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.94

97487,kevanb,2013-08-31,"   650ml bottle, poured into a Lawson's Finest Liquids Tulip glass. The beer pours a nice, golden honey color with a clear texture and just a slight haze. Many bubbles rise to the top of the glass that boasts a fluffy, white head that has good retention and leaves a nice amount of soapy lace behind. The aroma is simple and while it showcases the ingredients, does come across a bit blandly, light hop spice, lots of banana bread with just slight maple and earthy bark profiles with some cracked wheat that lingers. A nice amount of mapley banana bread on the tongue, high levels of pale wheat grain, tree bark, a bit of crisp hop oil but the beer definitely reads as both sweet and savory with a lot of earthiness. The body is crisp, lively coats the mouth well. It comes across as very full bodied for such a light beer, which I really liked, the finish is nice, a bit prickly but quite smooth. Verdict: An interesting experiment, but I'm not sure this one really works. The maple presence is very soft and mild and doesn't really compliment the wheat, but it's saving grace is that the beer is quite refreshing. A rare blemish on Lawson's fine record of producing great beer.  ",4.5,3.0,3.25,4.25,3.25,3.37

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, spice, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and spice flavors on the finish.

97487,scotorum,2013-08-18,"   Six ounce draft at the Prohibition Pig pub in Waterbury Vermont, with dinner. a: Clear amber with a finger thick white head which shrank away to a thin surface foam film. t: To be honest, I only had a few sips of this, it was ordered for my beer-hating wife in hopes the maple flavor would appeal to her, while giving Curious George (me, my name was changed to protect me from warranted lawsuits) a chance to try another Lawsons offering. Maple flavor was almost non-existent, although the color was maple syrupish and there were subtle undertones of such. However, I liked it well enough, and she did actually drink most of it, which is no mean feat for a brewer to get my wife to do. So kudos to Lawson's, who probably had the wisdom to recognize that maple syrup and beer naturally do not mix very well flavorwise. m: Light to moderate. Quite smooth. o: Seemed like more of a low-hopped pale ale with a hint of maple flavoring than the wheat beer dominated by maple syrup which one might expect. But it's an interesting and good-tasting brew. Perhaps it should be renamed Lawson's Lawless Liquid or Moonshine Through A Maple Tree or The-Beer-Scotorum's-Wife-Actually-Drank-Five-Ounces-Of or something else which might make it irresistible. It may be too good to just call it what it is.  ",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.75,4.0,3.86

276550,JerzDevl2000,2017-08-20,"   Bought this from Other Half a while ago and finally got around to it tonight. No date on the bottom this particular can though I realize that was over 4 months old by the time I cracked it open. Amazingly smooth and easy to drink, this easily ranked among the upper echelon of Other Half's offerings, which would be saying quite a lot! The pour to this was solid - murky, apricot, and topped off with a light and long-lasting spider web of a head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind though as there were only a few spots that remained on the side of my teku glass. Dank stone fruit, tangerine pith, and pineapple were in the nose with much more of those in the taste. Smooth and juicy, the citra could easily be felt from the first sip as the other, softer hops combined with the oats and alcohol to give this a muddled, depth and murkiness that lied underneath the surface. That slowly transitioned into a creamy sweetness as the lactose took hold, almost making this feel like a dessert beer when all was said and done. A light amount of carbonation ensured that the bubbles would stay in the background to odd-but-pleasing flavor profile of this brew that grew on me as I worked my way through this. This had enough alcohol in it but it wasn't too overpowering or a detraction. Rather, the heft of it enhanced the chewy mouthfeel and full body that this carried, down to the lingering slickness and sweetness that was oh-so-pleasing. What a winner here and a pleasure for those who love nuanced IPA's. Oats and spelt are great if used right, which was certainly the case here!  ",4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.43

92925,ChaBrah,2014-08-28,"   Sucks, just sucks. This has nothing on DogFish which is located pretty close by in the neighboring state of Delaware. This beer taste like its been brewed with penny's and skunked in the sun for months. Not impressed at all. For a beer that claims to come from Ocean City, MD yet its BREWED in Baltimore this is a scam. Cool name shitty beer, sad use.  ",,,,,,1.0
92925,ThisWangsChung,2014-08-25,"   12 oz bottle into a wine glass. Appearance: Pours a murky chestnut color. The head is a finger high and off-white in shade. Its creamy texture retains fairly well, leaving a nice collar behind, as well as some lacing. (3.5) Smell: From first whiff, I can immediately tell these brewers were influenced by Schlafly's pumpkin ale - and I can't think of a better beer to be influenced by. I'm picking up plenty of vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses; while auxiliary notes of cinnamon and allspice stay in the background where they belong. There is a slight gourd character, too. One of the better pumpkin beers I've encountered, at least on the nose. (4) Taste: Aye...it didn't translate down to the taste buds that well. It starts off with that vanilla/brown sugar/molasses trifecta the nose indicated; on the other hand, the back end sees an upsurge of strong cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. Once the palate properly adjusts to all the spicing, I'm actually starting to pick up a solid pumpkin flavor. After half a bottle, I finally start 'getting' this beer: it tastes less like pumpkin pie and more like...well, actual pumpkin. This deserves good marks for nailing the style guidelines quite well. It's not a glorified pumpkin soda, it's not a desserty pumpkin pie in a glass, it's just a beer with pumpkin and some spices (this is a compliment). (3.5) Mouthfeel: Despite the fuller body, it leans closer to dry than lush. No doubt, this is all helped by its decent carbonation...maybe TOO decent? At first, the drinkability is somewhat daunting thanks to the powerful spicing; after opening up, it becomes quite easy to down. (3.5) Overall: Oh man. If only this beer lived up to the aroma, it could have really given Schlafly's pumpkin ale a run for its money. Still, it's a rock-solid pumpkin ale, one that walks all over the lesser examples. Very well done, but it won't convert pumpkin ale haters thanks to its hefty spice characteristic. (3.5) 3.6/5: Solid pumpkin ale...but if only it tasted like it smelled...if only...  ",,,,,,3.6

92925,woodychandler,2014-01-26,"   My local, in-person trader, tone77, dropped this off for me recently, thus ensuring that my year of the pumpkin is not going to ever end. I like the style, but as with all styles, not all beers are created equal. From the bottle: ""Obscenely Fresh""; ""Hand Crafted""; ""If you drink like a fish swim home, don't drive - Fin City cares about you ... Drink responsibly!""; ""A tasty Brown Ale made with American malts, 100% real pumpkin, molasses, brown sugar and spices."" I will say this for it, following an initial pour - it smells pretty good! Once I had it all into the glass, I was looking at just over a finger of rocky, tawny head with decent retention. Color was more of a hazy orange (SRM = &gt; 17, &lt; 22) than a brown ale as noted on the label. The nose was intensely sweet with the molasses and brown sugar really taking the lead. I am curious as to how this will play out as I am not usually a fan of sweet anything, but conversely, I have had some pumpkin beers that were spiced to the point of saturation and I did not like them, either. Some nice lacing formed as the head fell while I was typing and so it was time for my first draught. Mouthfeel was medium and I was definitely getting cinnamon and nutmeg in the mouth, but the sweetness was there, just not in a cloying state. Hmmm. I was finding it quite quaffable and it was going down the hatch rather quickly. The finish had a pleasant dryness borne of all of the spices. It was not alum dry, but it was nowhere near as sweet as the nose had led me to believe.  ",3.5,4.0,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.77

Light ring of bubbles that quickly fades Nose is toasted malts. Nothing special here but I'm actually glad I'm not blasted by spice, clove et al This is a nicely balanced pumpkin ale... I am not the type who usually likes the pumpkin-pie spiced out beers, but this one is balanced nicely. This dude won contests with this brew for a reason; the Madagascar vanilla beans and 100% pumpkin shine through, and using reserve with the spice has thing thing tasting more like Pumking than any other bollocks out there...

125646,kevanb,2017-09-02,"   16oz can, purchased from the Brewery, not sure the date, but known to be very fresh. Poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 3.20.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal. The beer pours a very turbid golden color with orange hues that is very reminiscent of a glass of orange juice. A thick finger of white head rises with good retention and lots of spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of citrus, orange and grapefruit with some tropical pineapple, a bit of wildflower, sweet yeast, pale dough and some dank pine at the finish. The flavors really explode, lots of bitter pine up front, grassy hops, hop spice, grapefruit peel offer some more spicy bitterness with some refreshing tropical fruit juice with a sweet finish, pale grain, lightly yeasty. The mouthfeel is great, coating, creamy, medium body that has nice life to it with a dry and bitter finish. Verdict: A very nice DIPA from Tree House. Refreshing, bursting with flavor, well balanced, and as it warms, some pleasant bitterness comes out to contrast against the sweeter nature of the this beer which is much needed.  ",4.0,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.0,4.21

Offers a very intriguing hop profile on the nose, with a gentle diversity between herbs, grass, orange and lime zest. Got a nice sweet note from toffee malts, nicely adding to the juiciness of the fruits. Very refreshing, light bodied, well balanced with a soft effervescence and a challenging, perfectly integrated hop bite at the back end. Tastes of toffee accompanied lime zest, immediately establishing a hoppy dryness, thriving more complexity from a supportive grass note. Offers a short mineralic hint during midpalate, enhancing the hop presence in this, while the malts grow more profound as well. After the swallow this turns immediately surprisingly bitter, the hops now officially dominate the flavors with just a light note of sweet toffee cutting through. Very well made pale. Its hop flavors are challenging and diverse, while keeping everything in great balance. Can drink this all night, and it pairs very well with hearthy food.  ",4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.27

Pours a very hazy pale orange like watered down orange juice. Medium head that has very good retention and tons of lace sticking everywhere. Unlike some murky NE IPAs, this remains bright despite being super hazy. Nose is slightly bigger than Julius, but still didn't quite match what I expected based on what I'd previously heard. Nice orange zest, some tropical notes, and certainly yeastier than I expected. Taste is a little bolder with durian being the main fruit I get. Plenty of citrus and again that yeasty note. Mouthfeel is really pleasant and soft while still popping on the tongue like citrus pop rocks.

Some orange comes out as well but more so from when it is in the can than the glass. Tastes of pine, grapefruit, melon with a bitter backbone. Remarkably smooth despite the bitterness, very soft, modestly carbonated. No way you would know this is 8.2%. No doubt one of the best beers I've had in my life.

47604,Aaron_Ramson,2013-12-10,"   Cloudy orange amber color with thin head; nice spiderweb of lacing left on glass mug. Nose of sweet juicy fruit gum ending on a botanical spiciness. Spicy kick of rye is up front on the palate with resiny, grapefruit and pine hop flavor. Ends on a sweet caramel and chocolate note. Aggressively carbonated with a medium thin mouthfeel.  ",3.5,4.0,4.0,3.75,3.75,3.9
